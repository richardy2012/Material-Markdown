<blockquote>
<p>It is a very clean font and I very much like it, although I certainly think that there could be some beneficial changes made to it in order to increase the amount of awesomeness it contains.</p>

<h3 id="what-comes-next">What comes next</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Change the REGEX or whatever on the editor to bold headers and italisize <em>italisized</em> text. <strong>Bold</strong> stuff in a plain text editor is really kind of boring.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add settings functionality (at least now settings.json can persist the changes, so the problem of interacting between browser  windows is no longer an issue).</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out why Page.js is not working...not exactly sure what is going on with that..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fix stylesEditor and HTML export problem with js_beautify (still have no idea why it&#39;s not working)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add fullscreen editing mode</p>
</li>
<li><p>Default title of saved document to first header in document</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep it up, you should be able to release 1.0 stable soon (after you learn how to package it).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add find support...maybe do a bottom widget like in atom, or have the toolbar turn into the find bar like in a lot of material apps</p>
</li>
</ul>
